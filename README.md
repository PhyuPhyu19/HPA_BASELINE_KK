# HPA_BASELINE_KK
XLS programming file for HPA Baseline


## Purpose
This is the XLS programming for HPA food security and livelihood assessment in Kachin State, Burma. This product was planned to be used with the KoboToolbox platform and can also be applicable in other ODK-based platforms like SurveyCTO or ONA. Still, minor adjustments might be required as each platform has specific additional built-in features from basic XSL programming. 

## Usage
Upload the XLS form to the server and deploy the survey form. Then, ready to use for data collection with any android device.
